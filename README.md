# **Pytube- Analysis of Youtube Traending Videos**


# Introduction
YouTube today is one of the largest video streaming platforms in the world and yet the way its algorithm handles the content is still quite unclear. We all have had these questions while YouTubing on why certain videos are on the trending list while others are not. This question is especially important for YouTube content creators. YouTube Creators are individuals who produce content for the platform. This is a unique model that empowers Creators to earn money through placed advertising, merchandise sales, and subscriptions.

In this project, we try to understand how YouTube ranks its trending videos. We also aim to provide insights for Content Creators on the kind of content to provide in order to increase their probability of making their video trend and in turn generate more revenue.
